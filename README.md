# ðŸŒ¿ distToGreenAreas
Codes developed to analyse the access (distance) to green areas in urban areas of SÃ£o Paulo state. The data is related to the project [UrbVerde](https://urbverde.iau.usp.br/)

# Obtaining the layers used to calculate the distance to green areas
Here are the steps to obtain and analyse the distance to green areas based on OpenStreetMap data. <br>
[1] Urban census tracts <br>
[2] Centroids of urban census tracts <br>
[3] Squares and parks (green areas) <br>
[4] Distance to green areas <br>
[5] Analysing the results

## [1] Urban census tracts
_Type: Feature Collection_

This layer is obtained directly from official data (see [IBGE](https://www.ibge.gov.br/geociencias/organizacao-do-territorio/estrutura-territorial/26565-malhas-de-setores-censitarios-divisoes-intramunicipais.html). 
We select only the tracts related to urban areas based on a variable associated to each feature. The layer is ingested in Google Earth Engine manually.

## [2] Centroids of urban census tracts
_Type: Feature Collection_

This layer is obtained within Google Earth Engine. The centroids are calculted and then exported as an asset.
Here is the code we used: [centroidsGen.js](codes/centroidsGen.js)

## [3] Squares and parks (green areas)
_Type: Feature Collection_

This layer is obtained from Open Street Map considering the updated annual data. This layer is ingested in Google Earth Engine manually

## [4] Distance to green areas
_Type: Feature Collection_

This layer is obtained within Google Earth Engine. 
- Using the Census tracts, a list of municipalities codes is obtained. 
- Green areas are separated in two groups based on size criteria: 
	* green areas with less than or equals to 5000 mÂ²
	* green areas with greater than 5000 mÂ². 
- For each centroid, the distance to each group of green areas are calculated. Also, the nearest green area is calculated. 
-  All the results are saved as a property of each census tract centroid and exported as an asset.
	Obs. For the case of SÃ£o Paulo municipality, which the number of census tracts makes the memory been exceed during the calculation, the process is divided in tiles.
- The results are then merged and analysed externally.
<br>
Here is the code we used: 
- For all municipalities: [distToGreen.js](codes/distToGreen.js)
- For SÃ£o Paulo municipality: [distToGreen_sp.js](codes/distToGreen_sp.js)

## [5] Analysing the results
We provided a Google Colab to analyse the results. Check it [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1FhXUXSK_eeZ9YhH79mLUm2WFbkbAy3k2#scrollTo=TerFJQ6sHZ5s).<br>
There you can find instructions to get the results for your municipality. <br>
